	elocation-id = {2021.07.30.21261225},

	doi = {10.1101/2021.07.30.21261225},
	publisher = {Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press},
	abstract = {Deep learning models have received much attention lately for their ability to achieve expert-level performance on the accurate automated analysis of chest X-rays. Although publicly available chest X-ray datasets include high resolution images, most models are trained on reduced size images due to limitations on GPU memory and training time. As compute capability continues to advance, it will become feasible to train large convolutional neural networks on high-resolution images. To verify that this will lead to increased performance, we perform a systematic evaluation to measure the effect of input chest X-ray image resolution on accuracy. This study is based on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset, comprising 377,110 high resolution chest X-ray images, and provided with 14 labels to the corresponding free-text radiology reports. Our original hypothesis that increased resolution would lead to higher accuracy held true for some but not all of the tasks. We find, interestingly, that tasks that require a large receptive field are better suited to downscaled input images, and we verify this qualitatively by inspecting effective receptive fields and class activation maps of trained models. Finally, we show that stacking an ensemble across resolutions outperforms each individual learner at all input resolutions while providing interpretable scale weights, suggesting that multi-scale features are crucially important to information extraction from high-resolution chest X-rays.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis manuscript has been authored in part by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).
