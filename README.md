# Welcome to RADIA -  The radiologist assistant powered by AI


DISCLAIMER : This project is not intended to replace radiologists. It is a tool that can help them in their daily work.
This release was made at the end of my internship and as such may not reflect the current state of the project. The CIUSSS Centre Sude de l'Ã®le de 
Montreal is not associated with the publication of the code and the results presented here.
## What is RADIA?

RADIA is a project laumched by the CIUSSS Centre Sud de l'ile de Montreal. The goal of the proejct was to study the feasibility of using AI to assist radiologists in their daily work. 
I've worked on it for 6 months as a Machine Learning intern.

## What does RADIA do?

RADIA  is based off the CheXnet and CheXpert research papers. It is a deep learning model that can detect about 14 different diseases from chest X-rays.

## How does RADIA work?

RADIA used a deep convolutional model in order to generate a probability for each disease. The model was trained on the CheXpert dataset. A demo of  the model was then deployed internally on a web application that allows radiologists to upload chest X-rays and get a prediction for each disease.


## Results

The model was able to achieve an average F1-score of 0.59 , which is 4% under the current estimated performance of a human radiologist. I also attempted 
to train the model on local data from hospitals under the CCSMTL governance, but the quality of the data was not good enough to allow 
the correct evaluation of the performanceof the model (too much noise in the validation/test set)

## My contribution

During my internship, I worked on the following tasks:
- Planning and organizing the project
- Tasks allocation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Model explainability (Using Grad-CAM)
- Model deployment
- Web application development (Using Flask)

I've reproduced the results from different State of the Art models published in the CheXpert competition, while working 
on the project. I've also tried to improve the performance of the model by using different data augmentation techniques,
and tested many different approaches to work with the limitation of the noisy data from the hospitals.
